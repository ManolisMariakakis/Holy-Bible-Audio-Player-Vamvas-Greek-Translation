# Holy Bible Audio Player in Greek - Vamvas Translation

This repository contains programs designed to process YouTube video sources of the Vamvas translation from the YouTube channel [@ekxeradio](https://www.youtube.com/@ekxeradio). The Python programs convert the videos into MP3 files and split them into individual Bible chapters. The HTML program serves as a web-based MP3 player for these chapters. The audio version of the Holy Bible (Greek Vamvas Edition) is available on the web page [Vamvas audio](https://ebible.gr/mp3player.html).

**The repository also contains the converted MP3 files, which are located in the `mp3` folder**.

- The first three characters of each file name indicate the book name.
- The number following the book name represents the chapter number.

## Program 1: YouTube to MP3 Converter `downloader.py`

This program downloads and converts YouTube videos to MP3 files using the `link.txt` input file containing the video IDs and desired MP3 filenames. The `link.txt` file includes all chapters of the Holy Bible Vamvas Greek Edition, sourced from the YouTube channel [@ekxeradio](https://www.youtube.com/@ekxeradio).

### How It Works:
1. **Input File Format**: A tab-separated file (`links.txt`) with two columns:
   - `link`: YouTube video ID.
   - `file`: Desired MP3 filename.

2. **Conversion Steps**:
   - Uses the `yt-dlp` library to download videos as audio.
   - Converts the audio to MP3 format with high quality (192 kbps).

3. **Key Features**:
   - Outputs MP3 files to a specified directory.
   - Uses a cookie file to bypass YouTube restrictions.

### Requirements:
- `yt-dlp`

## Program 2: MP3 Splitter `psalms-splitter.py`

This program splits MP3 files into Bible chapters based on an `input.txt` file, which specifies the start and end points for each segment. It is used to convert the 29 Psalm MP3 files into 150 MP3 files, each corresponding to a specific chapter.

### How It Works:
1. **Input File Format**: A comma-separated file (`input.txt`) with three columns:
   - Input filename: Name of the MP3 file to split.
   - End time: Time to stop the segment (`mm:ss.ss` or `999999` for the end of the file).
   - Output filename: Name of the resulting MP3 file.

2. **Splitting Process**:
   - Reads the MP3 file using `pydub`.
   - Extracts segments based on start and end times.
   - Saves the extracted segments to the specified output directory.

3. **Dynamic Start Time**:
   - Automatically calculates the start time based on the previous segmentâ€™s end.

### Requirements:
- `pydub`
- FFmpeg installed for handling MP3 files.
